## AI_Music_Composer

Generate original melodies using Markov chains and evolutionary algorithms. The program composes MIDI music that actually sounds musical.

**Features:**
- Define music theory rules (scales, chord progressions, rhythm patterns) in code
- Markov chain melody generator trained on rules you define
- Genetic algorithm that evolves melodies toward "fitness" (consonance, rhythm variety)
- Export compositions as MIDI files playable in any music app
- Visualize the musical score as a piano roll

**Masters Skills:**
- Markov chains and probabilistic modeling
- Genetic/evolutionary algorithms (selection, crossover, mutation)
- Fitness function design
- Working with audio/MIDI formats

**Tools:**
- `numpy` — probability matrices, random sampling
- `midiutil` — MIDI file generation
- `matplotlib` — piano roll visualization
- `random` — stochastic processes
